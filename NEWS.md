What did you do this week?

•	Kat

- Worked on Shiny datacamp course

•	Paige

- Put progress report on GitHub and did it wrong... but then fixed it :)
- Looked at data and noted interesting variables as a group
- Brainstormed with Ben and the group about how to get started 
- Had group meeting with Sarah where we pitched our general direction
- Coordinated communication with Sarah via email about setting up next meeting
- Reached out to Suzanne Palmer about Shiny, and sent follow up email after not hearing back from her.

•	Jocelyn

- Prepared questions to ask Sarah, including the expected timeline, specific vision, and datasets
- Worked on Shiny DataCamp

What is it that you're struggling with right now?

•	Kat

- I still don't know if we're on the same page as Sarah about the general vision, but I think starting with a dashboard will be good. I'm also worried about getting the dashboard done by 2/21, especially if Sarah is getting us one of the datasets we need by 2/19.

•	Paige

- Struggling to get Suzanne to get us set up with Shiny. Feeling a little stressed out about if we will have enough time to become familiar with it before the next time we talk to Sarah (Thurs, 2/21)

•	Jocelyn

- Through communications with Sarah, it seems that we will need to look for certain datasets to the project started as soon as possible.
I am worried about the quarter deadline.

What are you planning to do next week?

•	Kat

- Finish DataCamp on Shiny (and other necessary courses)
- Start working on dashboard!!

•	Paige

-	DataCamp on Shiny
- Look into packages 
- Get Shiny set up as soon as we hear back from Suzanne Palmer

•	Jocelyn

-	Finished Shiny and Census DataCamp
- Have a more clear plan about our weekly tasks and work distribution
