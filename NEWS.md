- Took notes during group meeting with Sarah, asked questions and clarified ideas about our vision Worked on Shiny datacamp course

-Brainstormed with Ben and the group about how to get started Had group meeting with Sarah where we pitched our general direction

•	Jocelyn

- Looked into the data and categorize the interested variables 
- Prepared questions to ask Sarah, including the expected timeline, specific vision, and datasets 
- Worked on Shiny DataCamp 

What is it that you're struggling with right now?

•	Kat

- I still don't know if we're on the same page as Sarah about the general vision, but I think starting with a dashboard will be good. 
- I'm also worried about getting the dashboard done by 2/21, especially if Sarah is getting us one of the datasets we need by 2/19. 

•	Paige

- Struggling to get Suzanne to get us set up with Shiny. 
- Feeling a little stressed out about if we will have enough time to become familiar with it before the next time we talk to Sarah (Thurs, 2/21) 

•	Jocelyn

- Through communications with Sarah, it seems that we will need to look for certain datasets to the project started as soon as possible. 
- I am worried about the quarter deadline. 

What are you planning to do next week?

•	Kat

- Finish DataCamp on Shiny (and other necessary courses) 
- Start working on dashboard!!

•	Paige

- DataCamp on Shiny 
- Look into packages on using Census data
- Get Shiny set up as soon as we hear back from Suzanne Palmer

•	Jocelyn

2019 - 02 - 7

What did you do this week?

•	Kat

- Came up with a list of questions for Sarah 
- Took notes during video call with Sarah Brainstormed vision for project

•	Paige

- Coordinated communication with Sarah, point of contact for the project, and with team members 
- Created questions to ask Sarah during the video chat Brainstormed vision for project

•	Jocelyn

- Created repository Brainstormed vision for project 
- Created questions to ask Sarah and took note during the meeting 

What is it that you're struggling with right now?

•	Kat

- I think the part I’m struggling with most is the logistics of how to do what they’re asking, which is essentially prove the ECC is not doing their job regarding childcare.

•	Paige

- What they want from us, specifically. The project seems extremely open, which is great. However, it doesn’t seem like they know exactly how we fit into their overall goals or mission as an organization.

•	Jocelyn

- What they want us to do and what we are capable of doing step by step. At a higher level, what we could add on it by doing research and looking for relevant datasets on our own. 

What are you planning to do next week?

•	Kat

- Look at the data file and familiarize myself with the variables, maybe start the cleaning process, do some background on the ECC and childcare laws in general 

•	Paige

- Look at the data and see if I notice any patterns or anything that could help point our project in a specific direction 
- Get our progress report on the repository Have another video chat with Sarah, as a group, after we all have the opportunity to look at the data and further brainstorm what we want this project to look like. 

•	Jocelyn

- Be more clear about what the final product will be like 
- Look at the data file and figure out if we could build the product Sarah wants out of it. If yes, start cleaning the data and play around with the variables. If not, proposing some ideas. Have another video chat with Sarah
