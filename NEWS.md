What did you do this week?

- Worked on Shiny datacamp course

•	Paige

- Put progress report on GitHub and did it wrong... but then fixed it :)
- Looked at data and noted interesting variables as a group
- Brainstormed with Ben and the group about how to get started 
- Had group meeting with Sarah where we pitched our general direction
- Coordinated communication with Sarah via email about setting up next meeting
- Reached out to Suzanne Palmer about Shiny, and sent follow up email after not hearing back from her.

•	Jocelyn

- Created repository 
- Brainstormed vision for project
- Created questions to ask Sarah and took note during the meeting

What is it that you're struggling with right now?

•	Kat

- I still don't know if we're on the same page as Sarah about the general vision, but I think starting with a dashboard will be good. I'm also worried about getting the dashboard done by 2/21, especially if Sarah is getting us one of the datasets we need by 2/19.

•	Paige

- Struggling to get Suzanne to get us set up with Shiny. Feeling a little stressed out about if we will have enough time to become familiar with it before the next time we talk to Sarah (Thurs, 2/21)

•	Jocelyn

-	What they want us to do and what we are capable of doing step by step. At a higher level, what we could add on it by doing research and looking for relevant datasets on our own.

What are you planning to do next week?

•	Kat

- Finish DataCamp on Shiny (and other necessary courses)
- Start working on dashboard!!

•	Paige

-	DataCamp on Shiny
- Look into packages 
- Get Shiny set up as soon as we hear back from Suzanne Palmer

•	Jocelyn

-	Be more clear about what the final product will be like
-	Look at the data file and figure out if we could build the product Sarah wants out of it. If yes, start cleaning the data and play around with the variables. If not, proposing some ideas.
-	Have another video chat with Sarah
