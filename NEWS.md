## What is it that you're struggling with right now?

•	Kat

- I think the part I’m struggling with most is the logistics of how to do what they’re asking, which is essentially prove the ECC is not doing their job regarding childcare.

- What they want from us, specifically. The project seems extremely open, which is great. However, it doesn’t seem like they know exactly how we fit into their overall goals or mission as an organization.

•	Jocelyn

•	Jocelyn

- Look at the data file and figure out if we could build the product Sarah wants out of it. If yes, start cleaning the data and play around with the variables. If not, proposing some ideas. Have another video chat with Sarah
