##RUN PROVIDERS_IN_POLYGONS.RMD before this!!!!

#packages
```{r Packages}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

library(sf)

#data/APIs
```{r}
boston_neighborhood <- read_sf("Boston_Neighborhoods/Boston_Neighborhoods.shp")
tractneighborho <- read.csv("tractneighborho.csv")
api_key <- "8fa9f8cc6afff6f16cfa41d92974f406a35636a6"
census_api_key(api_key)
```

Adding geometry into tract neighborhood file
```{r}
#add back geometry
masterdataframe_tract_g <- cbind(classification2, EECMaster49)
masterdataframe_tract_neighborho_g <- cbind(classification4, masterdataframe_tract_g)

tractneighborho_geo<-masterdataframe_tract_neighborho_g%>%
  select(Name_neighborho,Neighborho_neighborho,geometry_neighborho,NAMELSAD_tract,GEOID_tract,geometry_tract)

tractneighborho_geo<-tractneighborho_geo[!duplicated(tractneighborho_geo[,'GEOID_tract']),]
```


Getting the variables
```{r}
#percentage of children under 6 with all parents in the labor force, 1 for single-parent household, 2 for two-parent household in each census tract in Boston.

#variables for all parents in the labor force (both double & single family households)
laborforcevars <- c("B23008_004", "B23008_010", "B23008_013")

laborforce_under6  <- get_acs(geography = "tract",
                     variables = laborforcevars,
                     survey="acs5",
                     state= "MA",
                     county="Suffolk",
                geometry=TRUE)

#get a sum of children with all parents in the labor force
laborforce_under6 <- laborforce_under6 %>%
  group_by(GEOID, NAME) %>%
  summarise(laborforcechildren = sum(estimate))

#get the total number of children under 6
under6total <- get_acs(geography = "tract",
                     variables = "B23008_002",
                     survey="acs5",
                     state= "MA",
                     county="Suffolk",
                geometry=TRUE)

#join the two files (by turning into data frame)
percentage_under_6 <- inner_join(laborforce_under6 %>% as.data.frame(), under6total %>% as.data.frame(), by = "GEOID")

#merge this with neighborhood tract information
colnames(tractneighborho_geo)[5] <- "GEOID"
percentageunder6_neighborhood <- inner_join(percentage_under_6, tractneighborho_geo, by ="GEOID")

#turning back into an sf object
percentageunder6_neighborhood <- percentageunder6_neighborhood %>%
  select(GEOID, Name_neighborho, NAMELSAD_tract, laborforcechildren, estimate, geometry_neighborho, geometry_tract) %>% 
  st_sf(sf_column_name = 'geometry_neighborho')

percentageunder6_tract <- percentageunder6_neighborhood %>%
  select(GEOID, Name_neighborho, NAMELSAD_tract, laborforcechildren, estimate, geometry_neighborho, geometry_tract) %>% 
  st_sf(sf_column_name = 'geometry_tract')

#getting estimates per neighborhood and tract with neighborhood geometry and tract geometry
neighborho_demand <- percentageunder6_neighborhood %>%
  group_by(Name_neighborho) %>%
  summarise(laborforce = sum(laborforcechildren))

neighborho_demand_tract <- percentageunder6_tract %>%
  group_by(NAMELSAD_tract) %>%
  summarise(laborforce = sum(laborforcechildren))


```


supply data
```{r}
EECNEW5<-read.csv("masterdataframe_tract.csv")

#early ed filter grouped by tract, summarized for capacity
EECNEW5_earlyed_tract <- EECNEW5 %>%
  filter(early_ed==TRUE) %>%
  group_by(GEOID_tract, NAMELSAD_tract) %>%
  summarise(sum_capacity = sum(Capacity))


EECNEW5_earlyed_tract$GEOID <- as.character(EECNEW5_earlyed_tract$GEOID_tract)

EEC_geometry <- inner_join(EECNEW5_earlyed_tract %>% as.data.frame(), percentage_under_6 %>% as.data.frame(), by = "GEOID")

EEC_geometry <- EEC_geometry %>%
  st_sf(sf_column_name = 'geometry.x')

#merge neighborhood information
EECcapacity <- inner_join(EEC_geometry %>% as.data.frame(), tractneighborho_geo, by ="GEOID")

EEC_neigh_geometry <- EECcapacity %>%
  st_sf(sf_column_name = 'geometry_neighborho')

EEC_tract_geometry <- EECcapacity %>%
  st_sf(sf_column_name = 'geometry_tract')

#summarizing capacity!!
neighborho_capacity <- EEC_neigh_geometry %>%
  group_by(Name_neighborho) %>%
  summarise(slots = sum(sum_capacity))

neighborho_capacity_tract <- EEC_tract_geometry %>%
  group_by(NAMELSAD_tract.x) %>%
  summarise(slots = sum(sum_capacity))
```

Getting difference between slot capacity and demand by neighborhood
```{r}
#more merging baby!!!
EEC_census <- inner_join(neighborho_capacity %>% as.data.frame(), neighborho_demand %>% as.data.frame(), by = "Name_neighborho")

EEC_census <- EEC_census %>%
  select(Name_neighborho, slots, laborforce, geometry_neighborho.x) %>%
  st_sf(sf_column_name = 'geometry_neighborho.x') %>%
  mutate(differenceslots = slots-laborforce,
         ratioslots= laborforce/slots,
         more_slots = ifelse(differenceslots>0, "yes", "no"))
```



Make the map: two by tract (supply and demand), one by neighborhood for difference 
```{r}
#transform sf type to work with leaflet
neighborho_demand <- neighborho_demand %>%
  st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326")

neighborho_demand_tract <- neighborho_demand_tract %>%
  st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326")

neighborho_capacity <- neighborho_capacity %>%
  st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326")

neighborho_capacity_tract <- neighborho_capacity_tract %>%
  st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326")
```

```{r}
