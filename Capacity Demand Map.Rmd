Getting the variables
```{r}
#percentage of children under 6 with all parents in the labor force, 1 for single-parent household, 2 for two-parent household in each census tract in Boston.

#variables for all parents in the labor force (both double & single family households)
laborforcevars <- c("B23008_004", "B23008_010", "B23008_013")

laborforce_under6  <- get_acs(geography = "tract",
                     variables = laborforcevars,
                     survey="acs5",
                     state= "MA",
                     county="Suffolk",
                geometry=TRUE)

#get a sum of children with all parents in teh labor forcein the labor force
laborforce_under6 <- laborforce_under6 %>%
  group_by(GEOID, NAME) %>%
  summarise(laborforcechildren = sum(estimate))

#get the total number of children under 6
under6total <- get_acs(geography = "tract",
                     variables = "B23008_002",
                     survey="acs5",
                     state= "MA",
                     county="Suffolk",
                geometry=TRUE)

#join the two files (by turning into data frame)
percentage_under_6 <- inner_join(laborforce_under6 %>% as.data.frame(), under6total %>% as.data.frame(), by = "GEOID")

#turning back into an sf object
percentage_under_6 <- percentage_under_6 %>%
  st_sf(sf_column_name = 'geometry.x')

#turn two numbers into a percentage
percentage_under_6 <- percentage_under_6 %>%
  mutate(percent_working = laborforcechildren/estimate*100)
```


Make the map
```{r}
#making palettes
pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = percentage_under_6$percent_working)
percent6pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = percentage_under_6$percent_working)

#transform sf type to work with leaflet
percentage_under_6 <- percentage_under_6 %>%
  st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326")

#make map
leaflet(percentage_under_6) %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB")  %>%

  weight = 2,
  opacity = .8,
  color = "white",
  dashArray = "3",
  fillOpacity = 0.7) %>%
